# Made for HackNJIT 2014
Made solo in 24 hours for HackNJIT. Excuse poor code, the excuse is the time limit. Excuse the poor artwork, too. The excuse is the lack of artistic ability, haha.

### What is it?

It's a collection of cooperative minigames based around being cooperative with your mice. The game state is synchronized across each client. Here's a picture of one of the challenges, where the goal is to form a regular n-sided polygon:

### Dependencies

* JSPP to handle JS preprocessing. (https://code.google.com/p/jspp/)
* JQuery is used to interpolate some values for animation. (http://jquery.com/)
* Victor.js is used for basic vector math. (http://victorjs.org/)

### Where can I play it?

Nowhere. I haven't yet open-sourced the server and I can't host it myself right now. :~(
